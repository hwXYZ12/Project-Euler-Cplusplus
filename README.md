Selected Project Euler problems solely written in C++ (from the site https://projecteuler.net/archives )

The problems are:  
3,4,7,8,10,11,12,16,17,18,19,20-24,67,488

Presumably the skipped problems are problems I did with pen and paper.

I was one of the first 100 to solve problem 488 and boy is it an ugly solution. I initially didn't want to submit the solution anywhere but the problem has been up for some time and if you can interpret MY solution then I suppose it's not such a big deal anyway. One could argue just trying to figure out what in the world I did would take longer than solving it yourself ;).

I've also included a BigInt class implementation and a Red-Black self-balancing binary tree implementation. Both of these were used to help solve problem 488. They are both badly written but suited their purpose. The red-black tree reference can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree.

These were some of the first C++ programs I've written :)
